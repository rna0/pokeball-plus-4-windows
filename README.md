## Input Mapping

This application maps the Pok√© Ball Plus controls to a standard X-Input layout. Not all X-Input functions are covered, as the Pok√© Ball Plus has a limited number of inputs.

| Pok√© Ball Plus Input | X-Input Control                | Status      |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------| :---------- |
| **Joystick**         | **Left Analog Stick**          | ‚úÖ Supported |
| Top Button           | A Button                       | ‚úÖ Supported |
| Joystick Click       | B Button                       | ‚úÖ Supported |
| Shake / Gyro         | *Right Analog Stick / gyro*    | üöß Planned  |

## Current Limitations

Due to the proprietary nature of the Pok√© Ball Plus, some features are not accessible with today's open-source knowledge. This application **cannot**:

*   Control the rumble/vibration motor.
*   Control the color or pattern of the LED light.
*   Play sounds through the built-in speaker.
*   Read or write the Pok√©mon data stored inside the controller.

**Important**: This application only reads input data and does **not** attempt to write any data to the controller. It is safe to use and will not harm your device or the data on it.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your Pok√© Ball Plus working on your PC.

### Prerequisites

1.  A **Pok√© Ball Plus** controller.
2.  **Windows 10** (or newer) with Bluetooth support.
3.  The **ViGEmBus Driver**.

### Installation & Setup Guide

1.  **Prepare Your System**
    *   **Download the Application**: Grab the latest `PokeballPlus4Windows.zip` from the **[Releases Page](https://github.com/rna0/pokeball-plus-4-windows/releases)**.
    *   **Install ViGEmBus Driver**: If you haven't already, download and install the latest driver from the official [**ViGEmBus Releases Page**](https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmBus/releases). This is a one-time setup.
    *   **Remove Old Pairings**: Go to your Windows Bluetooth settings and remove any existing "Pokemon PBP" devices to ensure a clean connection.

2.  **Run the Application**
    *   Unzip the downloaded file.
    *   Run `PokeballPlus4Windows.exe`. The application will start and run quietly in your system tray.

3.  **Connect Your Pok√© Ball Plus**
    *   Press the **top button** on your Pok√© Ball Plus. The light will start blinking white, indicating it's in pairing mode.
    *   The application will automatically detect and connect to the controller.
    *   You'll know it's successfully connected when the **white light on the controller turns off**.

Your controller is now ready! It will be recognized by Windows and games as a standard X-Input controller.

## Future Plans

*   **Gyro Support**: Implement motion controls to map the Pok√© Ball's gyroscope to the right analog stick, enabling camera control in many games.

## How It Works

This application continuously scans for paired Bluetooth LE devices that match the Pok√© Ball Plus. Once a device is found, it establishes a connection to read the input data for the joystick and buttons. This data is then translated and fed into a virtual X-Input controller created by the ViGEmBus driver, making it universally compatible with games that support XInput.
